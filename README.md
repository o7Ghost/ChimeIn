# Known Bugs
- Users may occasionally be able to submit or be unable to submit when they are not supposed to if the internet connection is spotty, so if this is the case simply refresh the page.
- Due to how we implemented user authentication, you cannot log in to two different accounts in different tabs of the same browser, so if this is desired functionality, use either the private browsing function of the same browser or use a different browser on the same system altogether.
